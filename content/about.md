Experience since 2005 in leading IT projects, including projects for telco, banking and financial management. During the first years, I have been working as a Software Engineering, this has given me the opportunity to learn and improve different programming languages, analysis methods, agile methodologies and implementation methods.

As a Developer, I have always been driven to build new and innovative products. I focus on usability and (high) performance. As a team and project leader my main objective is leading the team to higher levels of high performance by leading each member to reach their full potential through self-motivation and positive attitude.

During the last years, I also played the Scrum Master role alongside with the team leader role. Recently I became Agile Coach.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology and love to build applications, so, in my free time I like to learn new programming languages, challenge myself! The three that I have developed more recently are an application to manage club members (associous.com), another to pick you movies (moviepick.me) and the last one is to manage stocks.

As a professional I define myself as:

+ Self-motivated and positive attitude;
+ Team player and leadership skills;
+ Influencer and evangelist;
+ Communication skills; and
+ Quick adaptation and fast learner.
