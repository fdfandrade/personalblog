      <description>Experience since 2005 in leading IT projects, including projects for telco, banking and financial management. During the first years, I have been working as a Software Engineering, this has given me the opportunity to learn and improve different programming languages, analysis methods, agile methodologies and implementation methods.
As a Developer, I have always been driven to build new and innovative products. I focus on usability and (high) performance. As a team and project leader my main objective is leading the team to higher levels of high performance by leading each member to reach their full potential through self-motivation and positive attitude.</description>
